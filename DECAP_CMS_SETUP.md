## 🔧 Deployment Setup

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)

1. **Deploy to Netlify**: Connect your repository to Netlify
2. **Enable Git Gateway**:
   - Go to your Netlify site dashboard
   - Navigate to `Settings` > `Identity`
   - Click `Enable Identity`
   - Under `Registration preferences`, select "Invite Only" (recommended)
   - Go to `Settings` > `Identity` > `Services`
   - Enable `Git Gateway`

3. **Invite Users**:
   - Go to `Identity` tab in your Netlify dashboard
   - Click `Invite users`
   - Enter email addresses of people who should have access
   - They'll receive an invitation email

### Option 2: Other Hosting + GitHub

If not using Netlify, you'll need to modify the backend configuration in `static/admin/config.yml`:

```yaml
backend:
  name: github
  repo: your-username/your-repo-name
  branch: main
```

Then set up OAuth authentication through GitHub Apps or other supported methods.
