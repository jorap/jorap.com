# JoRap's World Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content-First & Markdown-Centric
All content, especially blog posts and pages, MUST be created and managed as Markdown files (`.md`). The content is the core asset of the project, and the architecture must serve its presentation and management.

### II. Static-First Architecture
The project MUST be a static site generated by Hugo. This principle ensures optimal performance, high security, and low hosting costs by avoiding server-side processing and databases for the frontend experience.

### III. Convention Over Configuration
The project MUST adhere to the established directory structure for content, assets, layouts, and configuration. This ensures predictability and simplifies maintenance. Any deviation from the standard structure requires justification.

### IV. Performance & SEO as a Feature
All development and content creation MUST prioritize performance and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). This includes optimizing images, ensuring fast load times, using semantic HTML, and providing relevant metadata.

### V. Automated & Multi-Platform Deployment
The project MUST support automated builds and deployments. It is designed with configurations for multiple platforms (AWS Amplify, Netlify, Vercel) to ensure flexibility and CI/CD best practices.

### VI. Baseline Widely Available CSS
All CSS MUST be compatible with the "Baseline" of widely available CSS features. This means targeting features supported by the majority of browsers for at least 24 months. This ensures a consistent and accessible user experience for the widest possible audience, minimizing the need for polyfills or complex fallbacks. It prioritizes stability and broad compatibility over cutting-edge features.

## Technical Specifications

The system is built on a modern, static-first technology stack:
- **Static Site Generator**: Hugo (Extended Version)
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build & Dependencies**: Node.js/npm and Go
- **Content**: Markdown

## Development & Deployment Workflow

Development workflow is managed via npm scripts for consistency:
- `npm run dev`: Starts the local development server with live reload.
- `npm run build`: Creates an optimized production-ready build in the `/public` directory.
- Deployment is automated via Git push to connected hosting platforms (Netlify, Vercel, AWS Amplify).

## Governance

This Constitution is the primary source of truth for project principles and architecture. All development, contributions, and reviews MUST align with it. Amendments require a pull request and review to ensure changes are consistent with the project's goals.
