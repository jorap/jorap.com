{{< lead >}}
A powerful, lightweight theme for Hugo built with Tailwind CSS.
{{< /lead >}}

This is a demo site built entirely using Congo. It also contains a complete set of [theme documentation]({{< ref "docs" >}}). Congo is flexible and is great for both static page-based content (like this demo) or a traditional blog with a feed of recent posts.

Explore the [sample pages]({{< ref "samples" >}}) to get a feel for what Congo can do. If you like what you see, check out the project on [Github](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) or read the [Installation guide]({{< ref "docs/installation" >}}) to get started.
