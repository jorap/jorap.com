Ask the same AI for the same WordPress feature on Tuesday and Thursday and you'll get two versions that both work and neither match. That's the problem nobody warns you about - and I'm glad I hit it early enough to write the rules down.

## The thing nobody warns you about

Month one with AI on WordPress builds: thrilled. Month two: annoyed. Month three: I finally got it.

The AI wasn't bad. It was *too creative*. Ask for the same kind of feature on Tuesday and Thursday, and you get two different versions. Different files. Different names. Different fixes for the same problem. Both work. Neither fits the rest of the project.

It's like a new contractor every morning - skilled, opinionated, and blind to what yesterday's contractor built.

That's not a code problem. It's a *consistency* problem. Once I saw that, the fix was obvious.

## AI isn't a developer - it's a fast new hire

A new teammate on day one doesn't know your file names, your definition of done, your existing helpers, or which mistakes the team already made once.

So you give them a short guide. After that, they stop guessing and start matching.

AI works the same way. Plenty of skill, zero memory of your project. Every new chat is day one.

I learned this the annoying way on one build: Tuesday's testimonial card and Thursday's team grid landed in different folders, with different helper names, doing the same job. Same project, same me, same prompts more or less.

Write down your house rules and put them where the AI will actually read them.

## The real win: reusable code for the repeating 80%

About **80% of what I build is the same patterns** in different clothes - blocks, cards, forms, lists, banners. That's true in WordPress and in most projects.

Most people ask AI to build each feature from scratch. That feels fast, but every feature drifts a little. You spend the time you saved cleaning up later.

Flip it: use AI to **build the reusable code for that 80%** - helpers, templates, shared boilerplate, a small set of "do it like this" examples. After that, new work is just new content in the same shape.

The valuable output isn't the feature. It's the **reusable code that makes the next forty features look the same**. AI is great at that work because it's repetitive - exactly where humans slip.

When that layer exists:

- New work looks the same no matter the day, mood, or chat
- You stop reviewing line by line because you know the shape
- Anyone opening the project can read one file and understand the next forty

The win isn't "AI was fast." It's *"every future feature comes out the same."*

(There's still ~20% that doesn't fit the pattern - that's where improvement and creativity live. I'll cover that at the end.)

## The 4-step process: build the 80% layer

This is what I do on WordPress builds - and any project where AI does a lot of the typing. **Have AI build the reusable 80%, then use it for every new feature.** Same idea for a site, a spreadsheet macro, or a recipe blog.

{{< image src="images/Consistent_AI_Web_Development_Blueprint.jpg" caption="Four-step blueprint for consistent AI output on WordPress builds" alt="Blueprint: name what repeats, one helper for setup, reference examples, then rules plus a standing instruction" height="558" width="1000" position="center" command="fit" option="q75" class="img-fluid" title="Consistent AI web development blueprint" webp="true" zoomable="true" >}}

### Step 1 - Name what repeats

Look at recent projects. What do you build again and again? For me, it's content blocks - pages are mostly blocks stacked together. Tuesday I asked for a testimonial card. Thursday I got a team grid with different file names and a different ACF field pattern. Same job, two shapes.

Name each repeating shape. One line each. That's what AI will build reusable code for. Skip this and nothing else clicks.

### Step 2 - One helper for the boring opening

Every shape starts with the same few lines of setup. On WordPress builds that's usually registering the block, enqueuing assets, and pulling ACF fields - the opening of every `block.php` looks identical before the markup diverges.

First helper I tried was named `block_setup()`. Next chat invented `init_block()`. Same file, three names, zero consistency until I locked one function in `inc/blocks/helpers.php`.

Ask AI for **one helper** - something like `jorap_block_open( $block_name )` in `inc/blocks/helpers.php` - that wraps that boilerplate and exposes a single function call.

This may be the most important file in the project. Every new feature starts the same way. AI calls the helper and moves on to the real work.

You're not saving keystrokes. **The first ~25 lines of every file match**, so there's nothing to drift on.

### Step 3 - A small library of reference examples

With the helper in place, ask AI for one polished example per shape - one card block, one banner, one list. You don't ship these as features. They're **references** in something like `inc/blocks/examples/card.php` - the recipe book.

I skipped this once and asked for "a testimonial card like the other cards." AI invented a fourth card style because it had nothing to point at.

"Build me a testimonial card" becomes "build me a card like `examples/card.php`." AI copies well when you point at a file. It invents poorly when you don't.

### Step 4 - Rules plus a standing instruction

Write down rules that aren't taste - they're safety. Mine look like:

- Escape user input on every field you render
- Match the project's exact labels (typos break translations)
- Bump a timestamp when a config file changes (or sync breaks quietly)

A client name field rendered unescaped once - fine in staging, ugly in production. That's when "escape everything" went into the rules doc instead of my head.

Ask AI to put five to ten rules in one plain-English doc in the project.

Add one instruction for every task: **"Use the helper. Mirror the closest example. Follow the rules."** Put the doc and that line where the AI reads them first - a `.cursor/rules` file, a `PROJECT.md`, whatever you use.

That's the contract. AI stops inventing and starts assembling from what you already built. New code looks like old code because the layer doesn't leave much room for anything else.

---

## What it feels like when the layer is in place

With those four pieces set, working with AI gets calm. I ask for a block and the AI:

1. Calls the helper for the opening
2. Mirrors the closest reference example
3. Follows the rules without me repeating them
4. Says what it used so I can spot-check

The result looks like something I'd write on a good day. It fits the project. Future me can't tell what was typed vs generated. That's the goal.

Not "wow, fast." More like *"of course it looks like that - it always does."* Boring. Predictable. Easy to ship. The 80% that used to change with my mood or which chat I used stopped changing.

---

## The other 20%

The rest doesn't fit the template - custom integrations, odd animations, pages that behave differently per user. That's not waste. It's the part of the project where you're allowed to improve things, try ideas, and be creative.

Locking down the 80% on purpose frees you here. You're not fighting drift on every block, so you have attention for the work that actually needs a fresh take.

Don't force the 80% system onto this bucket. Do add one guardrail: **"If it doesn't match an existing pattern, stop and ask."** That keeps edge cases as a conversation instead of a confident wrong guess - without killing the room to experiment.

Full system for the 80%. One light rule for the 20%. Creativity where it belongs.

---

## What this actually changed for me

**Stop asking AI to build features. Ask it to build the layer that makes every feature match.**

Using AI as a faster typist, one feature at a time, gives you speed and drift in equal measure. The layer is mostly a once-per-project cost, and every chat after it benefits. That hour on `helpers.php` paid for itself the first time I didn't have to read a whole block file to know what was in it.

These days I open a chat with one line: use the helper, mirror `card.php`, follow the rules doc. I barely read the diff anymore, and the codebase got boring in the good way.

I still get caught out. When a client invents a new ACF field label with a typo in it, nothing in the rules doc covers that, and I find the unescaped output the hard way. That's the 20% doing what the 20% does.

Not faster. *Consistent.* That's the part I wasn't expecting to care about this much - and the part I'm glad I finally learned to protect.
