## Key Secrets to Easy Arroz Caldo

**1. Use a Rice Cooker with a Congee Setting**  
The real game-changer: a rice cooker that has a dedicated **Congee** function. Here's what I use:  
[Hanabishi Congee & Rice Cooker Series HRCR2C](https://myhanabishi.com/collections/rice-cookers-3/products/rice-cooker-hrc-r2c?variant=45693133881625)

**2. Choose the Right Chicken**  
I recommend **chicken thigh fillets**. They're rich in fat, tender, and forgiving—even when cooked for a long time.
