One of my favorite Friday night rituals is prepping **Arroz Caldo**—a warm, hearty Filipino rice porridge that makes Saturday breakfast something to look forward to. This comforting dish is perfect when you need something easy, yet deeply satisfying. The best part? You can use a rice cooker with a congee setting to make the whole process hassle-free.

## Why This Recipe Works

### **Rice Cooker with Congee Setting**
The real game-changer is using a rice cooker with a **Congee** function. I use the **[Hanabishi Congee & Rice Cooker Series HRCR2C](https://myhanabishi.com/collections/rice-cookers-3/products/rice-cooker-hrc-r2c?variant=45693133881625)**, which makes my Arroz Caldo routine easy and consistent every time.

### **Choose Chicken Thigh Fillets**
Chicken thigh fillets are rich in fat, tender, and forgiving—even when cooked for long periods. Perfect for this set-it-and-forget-it approach.

## Ingredients

### **Essential:**
- **6–7 cups water** (or chicken broth for more flavor)
- **1 cup glutinous rice (Malagkit)** - rinsed thoroughly
- **1 kg chicken thigh fillets** - boneless, cut into bite-sized pieces
- **1 Knorr chicken cube** (or chicken powder)
- **3 thumbs minced ginger** (or Lee Kum Kee ginger)
- **4 cloves chopped garlic** (or garlic powder)
- **2–3 tbsp fish sauce (Patis)** - adjust to taste
- **1/4 tsp ground black pepper**

### **Optional Flavor Boosters:**
- **Kasubha (safflower)** - for color and aroma
- **1 medium diced onion** (or onion powder)

### **Favorite Toppings:**
- Kalamansi or lemon wedges
- Roasted garlic chips

## Pro Tips

- **Prep Friday night, enjoy Saturday morning** - This keeps well and tastes even better the next day
- **Customize your toppings** - Make it yours with different garnishes
- **Fresh ginger is key** - Use fresh ginger over powdered for the most aromatic and warming flavor
- **Water ratio matters** - Start with 6 cups water, you can always add more if it gets too thick during cooking
