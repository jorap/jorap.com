## Key Secrets to a Set It and Forget It Arroz Caldo

The real game-changer: a rice cooker that has a dedicated **Congee** function. This is the tool where I can prepare Arroz Caldo in the evening and eat it in the morning. Here's what I use:

I highly recommend **chicken thigh fillets**. They're rich in fat, tender, and forgiving—even when cooked for a long time.

# The Set It and Forget It Arroz Caldo

One of my favorite Friday night rituals is prepping **Arroz Caldo**—a warm, hearty Filipino rice porridge that makes Saturday breakfast something to look forward to. This comforting dish is perfect for when you need something easy, yet deeply satisfying. The best part? You can use a rice cooker with a congee setting to make the whole process hassle-free.

Whether you're new to cooking or just want to simplify your favorite Filipino dish, this guide will walk you through how to make the perfect Arroz Caldo using the rice cooker’s congee function. Let’s dive in!

## Key Secrets to Easy Arroz Caldo

### 1. **Use a Rice Cooker with a Congee Setting**

The real game-changer: a rice cooker with a **Congee** function. If you're not familiar with it, the congee setting is designed to cook rice with a higher liquid ratio, perfect for achieving that creamy porridge-like texture without constant stirring.

I use the **[Hanabishi Congee & Rice Cooker Series HRCR2C](https://myhanabishi.com/collections/rice-cookers-3/products/rice-cooker-hrc-r2c?variant=45693133881625)**, which has made my Arroz Caldo routine easy and consistent every time.

### 2. **Choose the Right Chicken**

Chicken thighs are my go-to for Arroz Caldo. They’re rich in fat, tender, and forgiving—even when cooked for long periods. You can go for bone-in or boneless, depending on your preference.

| Ingredient                          | Notes                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **6–7 cups water**                  | For the broth, or use chicken broth for more flavor |
| **1 cup glutinous rice** (Malagkit) | Rinsed thoroughly to remove excess starch           |
| **1 Knorr Chicken Cube**            | Or chicken powder for flavor                        |
| **3 thumbs minced ginger**          | Can substitute with Lee Kum Kee ginger              |
| **4 cloves chopped garlic**         | Garlic powder works in a pinch                      |
| **1/4 tsp ground black pepper**     | To taste                                            |
| **2–3 tbsp fish sauce (Patis)**     | Adjust to taste                                     |
| **1 kg chicken thigh fillets**      | Boneless for easy eating                            |

### Optional Boosters:

| Ingredient               | Notes               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Kasubha (safflower)**  | For color and aroma |
| **1 medium diced onion** | Or use onion powder |

### Favorite Condiments (Optional):

* Kalamansi or lemon wedges
* Roasted garlic chips
* Chopped green onions
* Hard-boiled eggs (sliced)

---

## Step-by-Step Process:

### 1. **Prep the Ingredients:**

* Rinse the glutinous rice under cold water to remove excess starch. This helps the rice cook smoothly and avoid clumping.
* Cut the chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces. If you're using bone-in pieces, you may want to adjust cooking times slightly.
* Mince the garlic, chop the onion, and julienne the ginger.

### 2. **Sauté the Aromatics (Optional but Recommended):**

* If you want to take the flavor to the next level, turn on the rice cooker and use the **‘Cook’** function to sauté garlic, onion, and ginger until fragrant (about 3-4 minutes). This adds a deep, savory aroma to your Arroz Caldo.
* If you prefer a more hands-off approach, you can skip this step and add all the ingredients directly into the cooker.

### 3. **Add Rice, Chicken, and Liquid:**

* Add the rinsed rice, chicken, and 6–7 cups of water (or chicken broth) to the rice cooker. Stir in the fish sauce, black pepper, and **Knorr chicken cube** or chicken powder.
* If you're using safflower (kasubha) or diced onion, add them here as well.

### 4. **Set the Rice Cooker to the Congee Function:**

* Close the lid and set your rice cooker to the **‘Congee’** function. Let the rice cooker work its magic, cooking the rice to a creamy consistency. This may take around 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on your rice cooker.

### 5. **Check and Adjust Consistency:**

* After the cooking cycle finishes, check the consistency. If it’s too thick, simply add more broth or water, stir, and let it cook for a few more minutes. If it’s too thin, you can run the congee function for a few more minutes or let it sit on the "Keep Warm" setting to reduce and thicken.

---

## Optional Toppings & Garnishes:

Top your Arroz Caldo with any of the following for added flavor and texture:

* **Fried garlic chips:** Adds a nice crunch and depth of flavor.
* **Chopped spring onions or green onions:** For a fresh, herbal kick.
* **Hard-boiled eggs:** Slice them and place on top for a protein boost.
* **Calamansi or lemon wedges:** A squeeze of citrus brightens up the richness.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips:

* **Too thick:** If your Arroz Caldo turns out too thick, simply add more water or broth in small increments, stirring as you go.
* **Too thin:** Let it cook for a few more minutes or let it sit on **Keep Warm** to allow some liquid to evaporate. You can also add a bit more rice if needed.
