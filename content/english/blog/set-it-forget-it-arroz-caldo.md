My Friday night habit is to prepare Arroz Caldo to reward myself for my Saturday breakfast.

## Key Secrets

The secret to a set it and for get it Arroz Caldo is to use a rice cooker with a Congee function. Here is the rice cooker that I use:

[Hanabishi Congee & Rice Cooker Series HRCR2C](https://myhanabishi.com/collections/rice-cookers-3/products/rice-cooker-hrc-r2c?variant=45693133881625)

Another secret is the chicken that is used. I use chicken thigh fillets. They have a high fat content and is forgiving when cooked during longer periods.

## Panlasang Pinoy

I start with a solid recipe and modify as needed.
