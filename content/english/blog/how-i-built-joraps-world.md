## Introduction

So, you want to know how I built "JoRap's World"? It was actually pretty simple once I decided to use Hugo, a static site generator, and host it for free using Cloudflare Pages. Let me walk you through the steps I took to set it all up.

## The Setup

I used to have a site built on Drupal, but I lost my hosting for it. This made me look for a more affordable and reliable solution to keep my site up and running. After searching around, I decided to use Hugo to build the site and Cloudflare Pages for hosting. Both are free and easy to use, making them perfect for my needs.

### Hugo: The Site Generator

First, I needed a way to build my website. After a bit of research, I found Hugo, a tool that lets you create static websites. Static websites are simple, fast, and don’t require databases, which makes them a great option for smaller projects.

Hugo uses templates and markdown files, which means that you can write your content in a straightforward, easy-to-read format, and Hugo takes care of the rest. I didn’t need to worry about complicated themes or layouts—there are plenty of free templates that you can customize.

### Cloudflare Pages: Free Hosting

Once the site was ready, the next step was hosting. I didn’t want to spend money on hosting, so I looked for a free option. That’s when I found Cloudflare Pages. It’s a platform that lets you deploy static websites without any cost. It connects seamlessly with GitHub, and once you push your code to GitHub, Cloudflare Pages takes care of the rest.

The best part? You don’t need to worry about servers or databases—it’s all taken care of automatically, and your site is super fast.

## Building the Site

Here’s how I built the site:

1. **Set up Hugo**: I started by installing Hugo and setting up a new project. This was just a matter of downloading the software and creating a new site with a simple command.

2. **Choose a Template**: After that, I picked a template for the site. Hugo has a lot of free templates, so I just picked one that I liked, and it was ready to go.

3. **Write Content**: The content is written in markdown files, which are easy to manage. I just created pages for things like blog posts, about me, and the homepage.

4. **Set Up Cloudflare Pages**: Once I had the site ready, I connected it to GitHub and set up Cloudflare Pages to automatically deploy my site every time I made a change. This process was really simple, and Cloudflare did all the hard work.

5. **Add Customization**: I didn’t need a lot of custom features, but I did make a few tweaks to the template to fit my needs. This included changing colors and fonts, and adding some personal touches to the layout.

## Going Live

Once everything was set up, I pushed the code to GitHub, and Cloudflare Pages automatically built and deployed my site. In just a few minutes, my website was live and ready to go.

## Conclusion

That’s it! I built and hosted my site for free with Hugo and Cloudflare Pages. It was a really straightforward process, and I didn’t need to worry about managing hosting or paying for expensive services. Whether you’re looking to create a simple personal site or a blog, this setup is perfect for getting started without breaking the bank.
