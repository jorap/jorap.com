## Step-by-Step Build Process

### Setup and Installation

**Step 1: Install Hugo CMS (5 minutes)**
- **Windows**: Download from [Hugo CMS Releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases)
- **Mac**: Run `brew install hugo` in Terminal
- **Linux**: Run `sudo apt install hugo` or similar

**Step 2: Create Your Site (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Create new site
hugo new site my-awesome-site
cd my-awesome-site

# Initialize Git repository
git init
```

**What this creates**: `content/` (pages/posts), `themes/` (design templates), `config.toml` (settings), `static/` (images/files)

### Configuration and Content

**Step 3: Choose and Install a Theme (10 minutes)**
1. **Browse themes**: Visit [Hugo CMS Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io)
2. **Pick one you like**: Look for "responsive", "modern", recently updated themes
3. **Install it**: 
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> config.toml
```

**Step 4: Configure Your Site (15 minutes)**
Edit `config.toml`:
```toml
baseURL = 'https://your-site.pages.dev'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'Your Site Name'
theme = 'your-theme-name'
paginate = 5

[params]
  author = 'Your Name'
  description = 'Your site description'

[menu]
  [[menu.main]]
    name = 'Home'
    url = '/'
  [[menu.main]]
    name = 'About'
    url = '/about/'
  [[menu.main]]
    name = 'Blog'
    url = '/blog/'
```

**Step 5: Create Your First Content (20 minutes)**
```bash
# Create an About page
hugo new about.md

# Create a blog post
hugo new blog/my-first-post.md
```

### Testing and Deployment

**Step 6: Test Locally (5 minutes)**
```bash
hugo server -D
```
Visit `http://localhost:1313` to preview your site.

**Step 7: Set Up GitHub Repository (10 minutes)**
1. Create repository on GitHub.com
2. Push your code:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial site setup"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Step 8: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (15 minutes)**
1. Sign up at [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)
2. Connect GitHub and select your repository
3. Set build command: `hugo`, output directory: `public`
4. Add environment variable: `HUGO_VERSION` = `0.147.7`
5. Deploy - your site will be live at `https://your-project.pages.dev` in 2-3 minutes!

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

**Based on real beginner feedback**, here are the most frequent issues and their solutions:

**1. Theme Not Showing** - Site displays basic HTML with no styling
- Check that theme name in `config.toml` matches folder name in `themes/`
- Ensure theme was installed as Git submodule: `git submodule add [theme-url] themes/[theme-name]`
- Verify theme compatibility with your Hugo CMS version

**2. Build Fails on Cloudflare** - Deployment fails with build errors
- Set correct Hugo CMS version in environment variables (`HUGO_VERSION = 0.147.7`)
- Check that `baseURL` in config matches your Cloudflare domain
- Remove `draft: true` from content that should be published
- Ensure all theme dependencies are properly included

**3. Content Not Appearing** - Pages exist but don't show on site
- Remove `draft: true` from front matter
- Ensure files are in correct `content/` subdirectories
- Check that menu configurations point to existing pages
- Verify content files have proper front matter structure

**4. Local Server Issues** - `hugo server` command fails or shows errors
- Port conflict: Try `hugo server -p 1314` (different port)
- Check for typos in config file (invalid TOML syntax)
- Ensure you're in the correct directory (site root)
- Update Hugo CMS if version is very old

**5. Git Authentication Problems** - Can't push to GitHub repository
- Set up SSH keys or use personal access tokens
- Check repository URL is correct
- Verify you have write permissions to the repository

**6. Images Not Loading** - Images display as broken links
- Place images in `static/images/` folder
- Use absolute paths: `/images/photo.jpg`
- Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Optimize image sizes (large images slow down builds)

## Daily Workflow: How to Update Your Site

**Purpose**: Once set up, updating your site is incredibly simple.

1. **Write new content**: Create `.md` files in your `content/` folder
2. **Test locally**: Run `hugo server -D` to preview
3. **Publish**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new blog post"
   git push
   ```
4. **Automatic deployment**: Cloudflare Pages rebuilds your site automatically

**Time from writing to live**: About 2 minutes after you push to GitHub.
