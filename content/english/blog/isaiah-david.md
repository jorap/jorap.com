## The Facebook Post that Started it All

On May 14, 2020 I shared this post in Facebook:

>Pia and I are so thankful for your prayers and support for Team Rapusas in this season of COVID-19 and ECQ. Our story has overwhelmed many of you with varying degrees of reactions ranging from a speechless jaw drop emoji to a ridiculous joke.
>
>I am taking the time to write the key phases of this amazing story but for this time I am giving a summary of what happened when Pia and I found out she was pregnant and gave birth to Isaiah David on the same day. We can truly say that God is a God of Miracles!
>
>- Pia and I were at home and she experienced abdominal pain which she thought was an extreme case of dysmenorrhea last May 6
>- Later that evening we had a doctor's consultation via chat and only bought her prescription the next day due to ECQ
>- On the morning of May 8, Pia felt that she was not getting better and took a home pregnancy kit twice to confirm she was pregnant. We shared the news to our families declaring that we got pregnant due to the ECQ
>- Pia was still in persistent pain so we went to the ER and hoped to get consulted by an OB-Gyne our next steps
>- Pia's first consultation in the OB-Gyne ward brought a commotion to the doctors there. The head of the department was only givng us an option to give birth right now in the hospital or transfer to another one
>- Isaiah David was born at 4:46PM via CS
>- The two doctors informed me that the baby was born full term (38 weeks) weighing 3.2 kilograms with an APGAR score of 9
>- I was puzzled why they didn't mention the baby's gender so I asked them and a doctor checked again and told me the baby is a girl
>- While waiting for Pia to arrive in our room, I made the announcement to our family
>- When Pia arrived in the room she told me that the baby is a boy which the doctors confirmed as well
>
>This is still a developing story and I hope to give details in every step of the way.
