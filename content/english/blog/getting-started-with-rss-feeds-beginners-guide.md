I used to be one of those people who had at least 30 browser tabs open at any given time. Every morning, I'd go through my daily habit of checking multiple websites. It was exhausting, and I was constantly worried I'd miss something important.

I discovered RSS feeds, and I thought, "Isn't that something from 2005?" Turns out, RSS never died – I just forgot it existed. And wow, has it changed my life.

## What's RSS, Really?

RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication" (though some say "Rich Site Summary" – honestly, who cares?). Think of it as a behind-the-scenes feed that websites maintain. When they publish something new, it gets added to this feed. Instead of you checking their site, your RSS reader checks the feed and shows you what's new.

It's like having a friend who reads all your favorite sites and then tells you, "Hey, there's new stuff on these three sites, but the other seven haven't posted anything yet."

## Why I Switched to RSS (And Why You Should Too)

Here's what convinced me: I realized I was spending about 30 minutes every morning just *looking* for new content. Not reading it, just hunting for it. I'd visit the same sites, see nothing new, then check again two hours later like some kind of content-addicted goldfish.

RSS fixed this immediately. Now I spend those 30 minutes actually reading instead of hunting.

Also, social media algorithms are terrible at showing you what you actually want to see. They're designed to keep you scrolling, not to help you stay informed. RSS gives you chronological, unfiltered content from sources you chose. It's refreshing.

## Getting Started: My Inoreader Setup

I've tried many different RSS readers over the years. Some were too basic, some tried to be too smart, and some just looked like they were designed in 1999. Inoreader hit the sweet spot for me.

The free version gives you 150 feeds, which sounds like a lot until you realize you'll probably end up with about 20-30 that you actually read regularly. I've been using the free version for over a year and haven't hit the limit.

### Setting Up Your Account

Head to inoreader.com and sign up. Nothing fancy here – just pick a username and password. The interface might look a bit overwhelming at first, but don't worry about all the buttons and options. You'll figure them out as you go.

### Finding Your First Feeds

This is where it gets fun. Most websites have RSS feeds, they just don't advertise them much anymore. Here are a few ways to find them:

**The Easy Way:** Many sites have a little RSS icon somewhere (usually in the footer), or they'll have a "Subscribe" or "RSS" link.

**The Slightly Less Easy Way:** Try adding `/feed` to the end of the site's URL. This works for most WordPress sites, which is like 40% of the internet.

**The "I Can't Find It" Way:** Google "[website name] RSS feed". Someone's usually figured it out already.

In Inoreader, just click the big "+" button and paste in the URL. It'll usually figure out what you mean even if you just paste the main website URL.

## Organization (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Folders)

I started by just dumping everything into one big feed, which was a mistake. It's like having all your emails in one folder – technically it works, but it's chaos.

Here's what I do now:

**Daily:** The stuff I check every day. News sites, a few key tech blogs.

**Weekly:** Longer articles, newsletters, anything that doesn't need immediate attention.

**Fun Stuff:** Design inspiration, comics, hobby blogs. The stuff I read when I want to zone out.

The key is not to over-organize. I see people with elaborate folder hierarchies that look like corporate filing systems. Keep it simple.

## Reading Strategy (Or: How Not to Drown)

Here's my biggest mistake early on: subscribing to everything. I thought more was better. Wrong. I ended up with 200+ unread articles every day and just gave up.

Now I'm ruthless. If I skip a feed three times in a row, I unsubscribe. No guilt, no "but I might need this someday." Life's too short to read content that doesn't add value.

My current routine: I check the daily folder with my coffee each morning (takes about 10 minutes), and I go through the weekly folder on Sunday evenings while watching Netflix.

## Common Problems I've Solved

**"This site doesn't have RSS!"** – They probably do, they just hide it. Try tools like RSS Bridge or just search Google. If it really doesn't have RSS, maybe it's not worth following regularly.

**"I have too many unread articles!"** – Hit "Mark All as Read" and start fresh. Seriously. That backlog isn't going anywhere, and trying to catch up will just stress you out.

**"I keep forgetting to check my feeds"** – Set a phone reminder, or just check them when you would normally check social media.

## Some Unexpected Benefits

RSS has done more than just organize my reading. It's made me more intentional about what I consume. When you have to actively choose to follow something, you think twice about whether it's actually worth your time.

I've also discovered some great smaller blogs that I never would have found through social media or Google. RSS democratizes content in a way that algorithms don't.

Plus, there's something satisfying about having a clean, organized feed with zero unread items. It's like inbox zero, but for content.

## The Bottom Line

RSS isn't sexy. It's not going to get a bunch of likes on LinkedIn. But it works, and it's been working for 20+ years. While everyone else is getting distracted by the latest productivity app or social media platform, you'll be quietly and efficiently staying informed about the things that actually matter to you.

Give it a shot for a week. Start with five feeds max, set up basic folders, and see how it feels. I bet you'll wonder why you waited so long.
