Sometimes life throws you curveballs that are so unexpected, you can barely believe they're real. That's exactly what happened to us on May 8, 2020, when our son Isaiah David came into this world in the most surprising way imaginable. What started as a checkup to determine our next steps in a lockdown turned into a story that would touch hearts across the Philippines and beyond.

## The Facebook Post that Started it All

A few days after everything happened, I found myself sitting at my computer, trying to put our whirlwind experience into words. On May 14, 2020, I shared this post on Facebook:

{{< image src="images/fb-post-isaiah-david.jpg" caption="Finding out you're pregnant and giving birth on the same day, during ECQ!!!" alt="Finding out you're pregnant and giving birth on the same day, during ECQ!!!" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q75" class="img-fluid" title="Finding out you're pregnant and giving birth on the same day, during ECQ!!!"  webp="true" >}}

[Facebook Post](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157266063333161&id=567318160&rdid=8BPSwIPMx743NK8z)

>Pia and I are so thankful for your prayers and support for Team Rapusas in this season of COVID-19 and ECQ. Our story has overwhelmed many of you with varying degrees of reactions ranging from a speechless jaw drop emoji to a ridiculous joke.
>
>I am taking the time to write the key phases of this amazing story but for this time I am giving a summary of what happened when Pia and I found out she was pregnant and gave birth to Isaiah David on the same day. We can truly say that God is a God of Miracles!
>
>- Pia and I were at home and she experienced abdominal pain which she thought was an extreme case of dysmenorrhea last May 6
>- Later that evening we had a doctor's consultation via chat and only bought her prescription the next day due to ECQ
>- On the morning of May 8, Pia felt that she was not getting better and took a home pregnancy kit twice to confirm she was pregnant. We shared the news to our families declaring that we got pregnant due to the ECQ
>- Pia was still in persistent pain so we went to the ER and hoped to get consulted by an OB-Gyne our next steps
>- Pia's first consultation in the OB-Gyne ward brought a commotion to the doctors there. The head of the department was only givng us an option to give birth right now in the hospital or transfer to another one
>- Isaiah David was born at 4:46PM via CS
>- The two doctors informed me that the baby was born full term (38 weeks) weighing 3.2 kilograms with an APGAR score of 9
>- I was puzzled why they didn't mention the baby's gender so I asked them and a doctor checked again and told me the baby is a girl
>- While waiting for Pia to arrive in our room, I made the announcement to our family
>- When Pia arrived in the room she told me that the baby is a boy which the doctors confirmed as well
>
>This is still a developing story and I hope to give details in every step of the way.

## When Our Story Reached the World

## GMA News Online

{{< youtube OPiYm82l9t4 >}}

A few weeks after our Facebook post, we got a call that honestly felt like a dream. GMA News Online wanted to feature our story. Sitting in front of our computer for that Zoom interview, it hit us that our little family moment had resonated with people in ways we never expected.

The journalist was so kind and genuinely interested in understanding our journey. They created this beautiful piece called ["The Miracle on May 8"](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/specials/content/155/the-miracle-on-may-8/) and when they posted the video on [Facebook, it reached 7 million people](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=325783961750143). Seven million! I still can't wrap my head around that number.

## 24 Oras

### Making Headlines – June 1, 2020

{{< youtube_time id="Oq27o4Y9hxE" start="0" end="90">}}

I'll be honest – seeing our story in the 24 Oras headlines was both thrilling and nerve-wracking. There we were, sandwiched between major political news about ABS-CBN's franchise and updates about Korean star Hyun Bin. Talk about feeling small and significant at the same time! Due to time constraints, they didn't air our full story that night, but just being mentioned felt incredible.

### The Feature That Changed Everything

{{< youtube TkDRQJYvsks >}}

When 24 Oras finally aired our full story, it felt like the whole country was watching. The segment in YouTube quickly went viral with over 2 million views. Reading the comments from viewers who were inspired by Isaiah David's arrival – especially during such a difficult time for everyone – was overwhelming in the best way.

## Sharing Our Faith – 700 Club Asia

After 24 Oras, we started getting calls from other TV shows, but honestly, with a newborn and the ongoing pandemic, we were pretty cautious about in-person appearances. The 700 Club Asia felt like the right fit because they understood our desire to share our story safely through online interviews.

### Our First Time Sharing Our Testimony

{{< youtube_time id="BVIahEuwbAo" start="0" end="582">}}

Walking into this interview felt different. This wasn't just about the unusual circumstances of Isaiah's birth – it was about sharing how we saw God's hand in our story. Speaking with their team felt like talking to friends who truly understood the deeper meaning behind what happened to us.

### Coming Back Years Later

{{< youtube_time id="4podOBCjOv4" start="940" end="1789">}}

A few years later, they invited us back for an update. Seeing Isaiah as a thriving, healthy little boy and being able to share how our family had grown – not just in size but in faith – felt like completing a circle. It reminded us that our story wasn't just about one miraculous day, but about how that day continued to shape our lives.

## Radio Waves – DZMM Teleradyo

{{< youtube_time id="iZBZGd8V604" start="3865" end="4925">}}

When Winnie Cordero from Winner sa Life reached out, it was our first time sharing our story on radio. There's something intimate about radio that's different from TV – you're literally speaking directly into people's ears as they go about their daily lives. Knowing that our story might encourage someone during their commute or while doing household chores felt really special.

## Beyond Our Expectations

- [Facebook Video – 7 Million Views](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=325783961750143)

Looking back, what started as a simple Facebook post to update friends and family became something we never imagined. In a year when so many people were struggling with uncertainty and fear, Isaiah David's story somehow became a beacon of hope for others. That responsibility – being part of someone else's source of encouragement – is both humbling and incredible.

**What Isaiah David's story taught us:** Life has a way of surprising us when we least expect it. Sometimes those surprises come wrapped in challenges, but if we stay open to the possibilities, we might just find that what seemed impossible was actually a miracle waiting to unfold.
