Social media platforms provide some level of control in designing how content appears and what content appears. Having too much control in designing your content was a downfall for MySpace which gave the ability for users to have horrible looking pages. Social media sites like Facebook provide a consistent look, but lacks the option to create your own look or functionality.

Many options that the current platforms provide is sufficient for the majority of users, but having your own site gives you total control on how you create your environment. This is your only choice if the content that you have violates their terms and conditions.

If you are a programmer, then is essential to have your own site. A programmer has the necessary skills to create a site. The best creation of anyone is something that is created for themselves as their personal outlet of creativity.

## To Create an Independent Online Presence

For social media influencers, a website is an insurance to ensure that they retain their influence. Having a social media account is only a privilege given by the social media platform of your existence in the platform. If you lose your account or the social media platform is shut down, then the influence in the social media platform is lost.

There are some users that don't even join any social platforms so there is another untapped audience. Having a website first is also a good strategy because you can create links in your social media platforms pointing to your website. Whenever a new platform comes along, there is ready content to provide for the platform.
