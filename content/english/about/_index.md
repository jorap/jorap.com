I am a passionate and experienced web developer with over 11 years of experience, specializing in front-end development and web administration. My skill set spans across multiple technologies, including WordPress, and PHP, with a strong focus on improving business processes through technology.

I’ve spent a significant portion of my career working remotely, offering web hosting, site migration, and troubleshooting services. My experience also includes providing customized WordPress solutions, including theming, updates, and email management. Additionally, I handle SEO optimization, Google Analytics setup, and social media automation, all while ensuring websites are secure, fast, and user-friendly.

My background in I.T. training and content development has also been instrumental in my career. I’ve designed training materials, taught IT courses, and provided post-training support to help users effectively adopt new technologies.

I am currently open to remote web development opportunities and always eager to collaborate on projects that allow me to apply my skills and help organizations grow through efficient tech solutions.
