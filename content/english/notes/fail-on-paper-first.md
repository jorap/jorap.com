title: "Fail on Paper First"
meta_title: "Fail on Paper First - Imagine the Launch Failed"
description: "Before you commit, imagine the launch failed - name why, then fix the plan while rollback is cheap."
key_concept: |
  - Fail on paper first is counting cost before the wall stops mid-air - failure on paper beats surprise in production.
  - [[Risk Management]] without failing on paper first is optimism wearing a spreadsheet.
level_1: "Fail on paper first is imagining the launch failed, naming why, and fixing the plan while rollback is still cheap."
level_2: "Ask what would make this birthday party flop before you send invites - cheaper to fix on the whiteboard than in tears Saturday."
level_3: "The room assumes the project died - list causes, then patch the plan before anyone ships."
level_4: "Pairs with [[Reversibility]] and [[Rollback Principle]] - failing on paper first asks what triggers the revert before users feel pain."
level_5: "Build a premortem that names likely failure paths, early signals, owners, and rollback triggers before the launch makes each fix expensive."
examples:
  - "Before we passed the static site to the client we listed three ways they would call angry - fixed DNS docs and scope line before go-live, not after."
  - "Team assumed the tournament format failed - whiteboard showed scheduling was the killer; we moved pools before registration opened."
