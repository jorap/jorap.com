title: "Free Tier Hosting Stack"
meta_title: "Free Tier Hosting Stack - Hugo, GitHub, Cloudflare Pages"
description: "Hugo, GitHub, and Cloudflare Pages ship static sites for $0 - until build caps, queues, or account limits bite."
key_concept: |
  - Hard caps on Cloudflare free: about 500 builds per month per account, one concurrent build, 20,000 files per deployment, and a 20-minute build timeout.
  - Static bandwidth is unmetered - the traps are build count, queue time, and fat repos.
  - Flow: Hugo turns markdown into HTML, GitHub holds source, Cloudflare Pages builds on push and serves over CDN.
  - Full walkthrough: [How I Built JoRap Notes](/blog/how-i-built-jorap-notes/) - same pipeline for [[Selling Static Sites]] and the [[Digital Garden]].
  - No database, no admin panel - which is why [[Static Site Client Scope]] matters.
  - One account hosting many clients who push often burns the 500-build budget fast; pin `HUGO_VERSION` on every project.
level_1: "Cloudflare free tier caps builds at about five hundred per month per account, one concurrent build, twenty thousand files, and a twenty-minute timeout."
level_2: "Like a shared metered hose - bandwidth looks unlimited, but build count and queue time drain the budget first."
level_3: "Batch commits, pin HUGO_VERSION, and count builds before you add another client who pushes daily."
level_4: "Fat repos and frequent pushes burn the budget faster than bandwidth - one account hosting many clients burns fast."
level_5: "Design a shared hosting policy that budgets builds per client, batches pushes, pins Hugo, and names when a site must leave the free account."
examples:
  - "Glad Hugo was pinned after the build failed - env var on every new project template now, and that failure still counted against the cap when twelve client sites hit 500 builds mid-month."
  - "Build failed until Hugo was pinned - env var on every new project template now, and that failure still counted against the cap."
