title: "Git-Based CMS"
meta_title: "Git-Based CMS - Buttons for Non-Git Editors"
description: "A git CMS commits markdown to the repo so clients get buttons while the same push-live build still runs."
key_concept: |
  - Publish via Git directly when you are the author; clients often will not.
  - Git stays source of truth; the CMS is just another commit path.
  - Still say no to bad dynamic scope - CMS does not add a database.
  - [[Minimum Effective Dose]] for solo sites: skip the CMS layer entirely.
level_1: "Git-based CMS publishes through Git commits as source of truth - authors push directly; clients often need buttons instead of terminals."
level_2: "Like a kitchen with a back door for chefs and a counter for customers - Git for authors, UI for clients who will never touch a terminal."
level_3: "Use Git publish for solo sites; offer a CMS when the client will never touch a terminal - still say no to bad dynamic scope."
level_4: "Git stays source of truth - the CMS is another commit path, not a second database that forks reality."
level_5: "Design the smallest publishing path for each site: direct Git for authors who can use it, or a narrow CMS that creates the same commits for clients."
examples:
  - "Church volunteer will not open a terminal - Sveltia on the repo, she edits announcements, Cloudflare rebuilds on save."
  - "I added Decap for a client who insisted on WordPress-like editing - honest scope: blog posts only, not plugins; still cheaper than hosted WordPress long term."
